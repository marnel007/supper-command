### Context Awareness
Suggestions adapt to:
- **Current directory**: Project folders get development suggestions
- **Time of day**: Morning = system checks, Evening = cleanup
- **Recent patterns**: Git users get Git suggestions
- **Command sequences**: Related command recommendations

### Pattern Learning
The system learns from your usage:
- **Sequential workflows**: Commands used in sequence
- **Time preferences**: When you use specific commands
- **Directory contexts**: Commands used in specific locations
- **Frequency analysis**: Your most common operations

## 📈 Performance & Storage
