### Adding New Commands
1. Create command implementation in appropriate category
2. Add to command registry in `internal/app/app.go`
3. Update help documentation
4. Add tests
5. Update completion mappings

### Mock vs Real Implementations
- **Development**: Uses mock implementations for testing
- **Production**: Real system integrations (Windows services, firewall, etc.)
- **Remote**: Currently uses mock SSH, real SSH planned

- Process isolation and privilege checking
- Input validation and sanitization

### Security Considerations
- Some commands require elevated privileges
- Remote connections use SSH encryption
- Firewall changes require administrator access
- Process termination requires appropriate permissions

## 📈 Performance

### Optimizations
- Efficient command execution
- Connection pooling for remote operations
- Lazy loading of system information
- Minimal memory footprint

### Benchmarks
- Command execution: < 100ms typical
- System health check: < 2 seconds
- Network operations: Depends on network latency
- File operations: Native OS performance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command Not Found**
```bash
help | grep command_name
lookup command_name
```

**Permission Denied**
- Run as administrator (Windows)
- Use sudo (Linux/macOS)
- Check user privileges

**Network Connection Issues**
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8              # Test basic connectivity
ipconfig                  # Check network configuration
```

**Performance Issues**
```bash
perf analyze              # Check system performance
server health             # Check system health
```

### Getting Help
- Use `help <command>` for detailed command help
