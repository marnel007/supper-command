8. WHEN I run `perf alerts` THEN SuperShell SHALL configure performance-based alerts
9. WHEN I run `perf history` THEN SuperShell SHALL show historical performance trends
10. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN SuperShell SHALL trigger automated alerts

### Requirement 3: Server Health Monitoring Suite

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive server health monitoring, so that I can proactively manage server infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `server health` THEN SuperShell SHALL display comprehensive server health dashboard
2. WHEN I run `server services` THEN SuperShell SHALL list all services with status and management options
3. WHEN I run `server users` THEN SuperShell SHALL manage user accounts and permissions

### Requirement 4: Remote Server Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage multiple remote servers, so that I can perform operations across my infrastructure efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `remote add <server>` THEN SuperShell SHALL add servers to the management inventory
2. WHEN I run `remote list` THEN SuperShell SHALL display all managed servers with status
3. WHEN I run `remote exec <server> <command>` THEN SuperShell SHALL execute commands on remote servers
4. WHEN I run `remote exec-all <command>` THEN SuperShell SHALL execute commands on all servers
5. WHEN I run `remote sync <source> <dest>` THEN SuperShell SHALL synchronize files across servers
6. WHEN I run `remote monitor` THEN SuperShell SHALL monitor multiple servers simultaneously
7. WHEN I run `remote cluster create` THEN SuperShell SHALL create and manage server clusters
8. WHEN I run `remote deploy <app>` THEN SuperShell SHALL deploy applications across multiple servers
9. WHEN I run `remote health` THEN SuperShell SHALL check health status of all managed servers
10. WHEN remote operations fail THEN SuperShell SHALL provide detailed error reporting and recovery options
