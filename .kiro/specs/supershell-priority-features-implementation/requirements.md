# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of priority SuperShell features focused on enterprise server management capabilities. The features include firewall management, performance analysis and optimization, comprehensive server management suite, and remote multi-server operations. These enhancements will transform SuperShell from a basic command-line tool into a comprehensive server administration platform suitable for enterprise environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Firewall Management System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive firewall management capabilities, so that I can secure my servers and networks through SuperShell without needing separate tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `firewall status` THEN the system SHALL display current firewall state, active rules, and configuration summary
2. WHEN I execute `firewall rules --list` THEN the system SHALL display all current firewall rules with rule numbers, protocols, ports, and actions
3. WHEN I execute `firewall allow --port 80 --protocol tcp` THEN the system SHALL create an allow rule for the specified port and protocol
4. WHEN I execute `firewall block --ip 192.168.1.100` THEN the system SHALL create a block rule for the specified IP address
5. WHEN I execute `firewall enable` THEN the system SHALL activate the firewall service and confirm activation
6. WHEN I execute `firewall disable` THEN the system SHALL deactivate the firewall service with confirmation prompt
7. WHEN I execute `firewall backup --file rules.bak` THEN the system SHALL export current rules to the specified backup file
8. WHEN I execute `firewall restore --file rules.bak` THEN the system SHALL restore rules from the backup file with confirmation
9. IF firewall operations require elevated privileges THEN the system SHALL prompt for administrator access
10. WHEN firewall rules are modified THEN the system SHALL validate rule syntax and prevent conflicting rules

### Requirement 2: Performance Analysis & Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed performance analysis and optimization recommendations, so that I can maintain optimal server performance and identify bottlenecks proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `perf analyze` THEN the system SHALL collect and analyze CPU, memory, disk, and network performance metrics
2. WHEN I execute `perf monitor --duration 60` THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor performance for the specified duration
3. WHEN I execute `perf report --detailed` THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive performance report with recommendations
4. WHEN I execute `perf optimize --auto` THEN the system SHALL apply safe automatic optimizations based on analysis
5. WHEN I execute `perf baseline --save` THEN the system SHALL capture current performance metrics as a baseline
6. WHEN I execute `perf compare --baseline baseline.json` THEN the system SHALL compare current metrics against the saved baseline
7. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with specific recommendations
8. WHEN I execute `perf history --7days` THEN the system SHALL display performance trends over the specified period
9. IF optimization requires system changes THEN the system SHALL request confirmation before applying changes
10. WHEN performance analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide actionable optimization suggestions

### Requirement 3: Server Management Suite

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive server health monitoring and service management capabilities, so that I can maintain server reliability and manage services efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `server health` THEN the system SHALL display overall server health status including CPU, memory, disk, and network
2. WHEN I execute `server services --list` THEN the system SHALL display all system services with their current status
3. WHEN I execute `server service --start servicename` THEN the system SHALL start the specified service and confirm success
4. WHEN I execute `server service --stop servicename` THEN the system SHALL stop the specified service with confirmation
5. WHEN I execute `server users --active` THEN the system SHALL display currently logged-in users and their sessions
6. WHEN I execute `server logs --tail --service servicename` THEN the system SHALL display real-time logs for the specified service
7. WHEN I execute `server alerts --configure` THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of health monitoring thresholds
8. WHEN critical system events occur THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate alerts and notifications
9. WHEN I execute `server backup --config` THEN the system SHALL backup critical system configuration files
10. IF service operations require elevated privileges THEN the system SHALL handle privilege escalation appropriately

### Requirement 4: Remote Server Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage multiple remote servers from a single SuperShell instance, so that I can efficiently administer distributed server infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute `remote add --host server1.example.com --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa` THEN the system SHALL add the remote server to the managed servers list
2. WHEN I execute `remote list` THEN the system SHALL display all configured remote servers with connection status
3. WHEN I execute `remote exec --host server1 --command "sysinfo"` THEN the system SHALL execute the command on the remote server and return results
4. WHEN I execute `remote health --all` THEN the system SHALL check health status of all configured remote servers
5. WHEN I execute `cluster status` THEN the system SHALL display status overview of all servers in the cluster
6. WHEN I execute `cluster exec --command "service nginx restart"` THEN the system SHALL execute the command on all cluster members
7. WHEN I execute `remote sync --config` THEN the system SHALL synchronize configuration files across specified servers
8. WHEN remote server connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
9. WHEN I execute `remote monitor --realtime` THEN the system SHALL display real-time monitoring data from all remote servers
10. IF remote operations require authentication THEN the system SHALL handle SSH key-based and password authentication securely
