# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring and improving the SuperShell codebase to address performance issues, security concerns, and maintainability challenges. The goal is to transform the current monolithic structure into a well-organized, secure, and thoroughly tested application while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Organization and Architecture Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining SuperShell, I want the codebase to be well-organized with clear separation of concerns, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shell.go file is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into focused modules with no single file exceeding 500 lines
2. WHEN commands are organized THEN each command category SHALL have its own package (networking, filesystem, remote, etc.)
3. WHEN global state is refactored THEN dependency injection SHALL replace global variables
4. WHEN the architecture is restructured THEN interfaces SHALL be defined for all major components
5. WHEN modules are created THEN each SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility

### Requirement 2: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a system administrator using SuperShell, I want all command execution to be secure and protected against injection attacks, so that my system remains safe from malicious input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN all commands SHALL be sanitized and validated before execution
2. WHEN elevated privileges are requested THEN the system SHALL validate and escape all command parameters
3. WHEN remote operations are performed THEN all connection parameters SHALL be validated and sanitized
4. WHEN file operations are executed THEN path traversal attacks SHALL be prevented
5. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN all values SHALL be validated against expected formats and ranges

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to SuperShell, I want comprehensive test coverage for all functionality, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are implemented THEN code coverage SHALL exceed 80% for all core modules
2. WHEN integration tests are created THEN all command execution paths SHALL be tested
3. WHEN security tests are added THEN all input validation and sanitization SHALL be verified
4. WHEN cross-platform tests are implemented THEN Windows and Unix/Linux compatibility SHALL be validated
5. WHEN performance tests are created THEN memory usage and execution time SHALL be benchmarked

### Requirement 4: Configuration System Enhancement

**User Story:** As a SuperShell user, I want a flexible configuration system that allows me to customize the shell behavior, so that I can adapt it to my specific needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are loaded THEN YAML, JSON, and TOML formats SHALL be supported
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN sensible defaults SHALL be provided automatically
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN clear error messages SHALL guide the user to fix issues
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN hot-reloading SHALL be supported without restart
5. WHEN user preferences are set THEN they SHALL persist across sessions

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a SuperShell user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and continue operating even when some features fail, so that I can maintain productivity despite issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN intelligence features fail THEN the shell SHALL continue operating in basic mode
2. WHEN network operations timeout THEN appropriate fallback mechanisms SHALL be activated
3. WHEN external dependencies are unavailable THEN clear warnings SHALL be displayed with suggested alternatives
4. WHEN memory limits are approached THEN automatic cleanup SHALL be triggered
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN detailed logs SHALL be written for debugging

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a SuperShell user working with large datasets and command histories, I want the application to remain responsive and memory-efficient, so that I can work effectively without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command history grows large THEN memory usage SHALL be bounded with automatic cleanup
2. WHEN intelligence data accumulates THEN storage SHALL be optimized with compression and indexing
3. WHEN concurrent operations run THEN proper synchronization SHALL prevent race conditions
4. WHEN large files are processed THEN streaming approaches SHALL be used to minimize memory usage
5. WHEN startup occurs THEN initialization time SHALL not exceed 2 seconds

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer working with SuperShell code, I want comprehensive documentation and clear code structure, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN all public functions and types SHALL have Go doc comments
2. WHEN APIs are defined THEN usage examples SHALL be provided in documentation
3. WHEN architecture decisions are made THEN they SHALL be documented with rationale
4. WHEN development setup is needed THEN clear instructions SHALL be provided
5. WHEN debugging is required THEN structured logging SHALL provide detailed information

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a SuperShell user and administrator, I want visibility into application performance and behavior, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are performed THEN execution metrics SHALL be collected and available
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be available through logging
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN detailed memory profiling SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN intelligence features are used THEN usage statistics SHALL be tracked and reportable
