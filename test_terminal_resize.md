# Terminal Resize Test Instructions

## Problem Fixed
The shell was having issues when the terminal window was resized and Enter was pressed multiple times. This caused:
- Lines being deleted instead of new lines being created
- Terminal state corruption
- Poor user experience

## Solution Implemented
1. **Simple Shell Mode**: Default to a simple, reliable shell implementation
2. **Better Terminal Handling**: Improved input/output handling
3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Better handling of terminal state changes
4. **Context Management**: Proper context handling for shutdown

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Shell
```bash
.\supershell-terminal-fixed.exe
```

### 2. Test Normal Operation
- Type commands like `help`, `sysinfo`, `history`
- Press Enter - should create new lines properly
- Commands should execute normally

### 3. Test Window Resize
- Resize the terminal window (drag corners/edges)
- Press Enter multiple times
- Type commands
- Should work normally without line deletion issues

### 4. Test Different Modes
- Default mode (simple shell): `.\supershell-terminal-fixed.exe`
- Fancy mode (go-prompt): `$env:SUPERSHELL_FANCY="1"; .\supershell-terminal-fixed.exe`

## Expected Behavior
✅ Enter key creates new lines properly
✅ Window resize doesn't break terminal
✅ Commands execute cleanly
✅ No line deletion issues
✅ Proper prompt display
✅ Clean exit with Ctrl+C or 'exit'

## Technical Details
- Uses simple `bufio.Scanner` for reliable input
- Proper context handling for graceful shutdown
- Better error handling for terminal state
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)
